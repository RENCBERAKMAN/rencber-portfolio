**Hello 👋 I'm Rençber.**
I am a Computer Programming student transitioning from game development to the architecture of secure systems. For me, coding is not just a profession; it is a way to materialize abstract thoughts into logic.

### 🚀 The Journey: From Game Dev to System Architecture

I started my journey exploring the depths of **C++** and **Unreal Engine**, which taught me how to think algorithmically. Now, I am channeling that discipline into **Backend Development** and **Cyber Security**.

Currently, I am building modular systems using **C#, .NET 8, and Clean Architecture**, while simultaneously learning how to secure them against modern threats.

### 🧠 Philosophy & Vision

I created this repository to document what I learn, what I build, and the obstacles I overcome along the way.
I view software not just as a technical tool, but as a medium that creates awareness and provokes thought.

I start with small projects, but my goal is to build meaningful works that reach more people and broaden their perspectives.

> When I write code, I always ask myself:
> **"What purpose does this line truly serve?"**

I am still learning, debugging, and growing. But on this journey, I am leaving my own unique mark. 🌱
